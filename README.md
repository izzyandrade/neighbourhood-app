# Neighbourhood App Project
This is my app for Udacity FSND Neighbourhood App Project. It contains a list of locations near in my neighbourhood. Such as some parks, a market, and 2 shopping malls. It uses Google Maps API and Foursquare API. Check it out!

The foursquare API just returns me the address of a venue so that I can display it in the header.
And the Google Maps API gets me the street view of the markers.

Hope you like it!

##How to run it

3. All set! You can play with my app and see how awesome it is.
